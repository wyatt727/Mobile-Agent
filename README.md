# Mobile Agent ü§ñ

An AI-powered command execution agent for NetHunter and MacOS. Control your Android device, launch apps, create websites, and perform security operations using natural language.

## Features

### NetHunter/Android
- **App Control**: Launch any Android app by name
- **Web Development**: Auto-deploy websites with single HTML block
- **Security Tools**: Integrated with NetHunter toolkit
- **System Control**: Screenshots, file management, monitoring
- **Browser Automation**: Open websites, perform searches

### MacOS
- **Playwright Automation**: Browser control and scraping  
- **System Automation**: AppleScript integration
- **File Operations**: Advanced file management

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/wyatt727/Mobile-Agent.git
cd Mobile-Agent
./install-mobile.sh

# Use the agent
agent create a simple web page
```

## Installation

The installer automatically:
- Detects your environment (NetHunter/MacOS)
- Sets up Python virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Creates system-wide `agent` command

### NetHunter
Installs to `/root/.mobile-agent/` - self-contained, can delete source.

### MacOS

## How It Works

The agent uses specialized prompts based on your environment:
- **NetHunter**: Full Android control via ADB
